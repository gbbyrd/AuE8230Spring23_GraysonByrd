Hello! I am a Masters in Computer Science student hoping to work in the field of artificial intelligence and robotics.

I am taking this class as it pertains to my research studies as well as my personal interests. I hope to develop the skills
necessary to quickly prototpye robotic systems and deploy and test various AI algorithms.

This repository will contain the work from Autonomy: Science and Systems. This course will cover ROS and the coursework
will be centered around building a proficiency in this topic.
